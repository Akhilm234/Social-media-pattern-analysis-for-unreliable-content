# Social-media-pattern-analysis-for-unreliable-content
This project basically on detection on detection of deepfake contents on social media.

1.INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This projects aims in detection of video deepfakes using deep learning techniques like ResNext and LSTM. We have achived deepfake detection by using transfer learning where the pretrained ResNext CNN is used to obtain a feature vector, further the LSTM layer is trained using the features. 

2.PREPROCESSING DATA
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To perform the preprocessing on videos u must the run the preprocessing code and get the frames and cropped videos from dataset.

3.MODEL TRAINING AND TESTING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this step we are taking the processed data into our pretrained model to check the accuracy of our model for further prediction.
u shld also include the global meta data given in the repository.

4.PREDICTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the training of model , we should give out test video and get the result..

Thank you..
